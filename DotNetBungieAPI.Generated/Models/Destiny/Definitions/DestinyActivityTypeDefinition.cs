///     The definition for an Activity Type.
/// <para />
///     In Destiny 2, an Activity Type represents a conceptual categorization of Activities.
/// <para />
///     These are most commonly used in the game for the subtitle under Activities, but BNet uses them extensively to identify and group activities by their common properties.
/// <para />
///     Unfortunately, there has been a movement away from providing the richer data in Destiny 2 that we used to get in Destiny 1 for Activity Types. For instance, Nightfalls are grouped under the same Activity Type as regular Strikes. 
/// <para />
///     For this reason, BNet will eventually migrate toward Activity Modes as a better indicator of activity category. But for the time being, it is still referred to in many places across our codebase.
